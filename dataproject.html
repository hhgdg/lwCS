   <h3> How how does your # of siblings affect your performance in school?</h3>
   
   <p> For our data project, my friend and I decided to research how your siblings, or how may siblings you have, affect your
       performance in school. My friend and I wanted to know this so we could give parents and siblings knowledge on whether siblings 
       improve, lower, or have no visible impact on school grades. To get some information from students, we sent out a survey, and 
       made a chart: </p>
