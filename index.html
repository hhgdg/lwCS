   <h3>Why'd I Make This Website?</h3>
   
   <p>Hey! Welcome to my portfolio website. I made this website using HTML and CSS as part of a computer
      science course I took. It's supposed to help me apply my newfound skills as a coder in a somewhat
      real-world environment. My CS Projects page shows off some other projects of mine. And lastly, if 
      for some reason you want to learn some boring facts about a boring me, you should visit      my "about me"
      page.</p>
