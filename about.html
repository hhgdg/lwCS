    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <h3>A Quick Bio</h3>
    
    <p>Congrats! You've found my about page. There isn't much to know about me. Chances are that if you searched up 
    "10 generic human traits" you'd have me described. I spend most of my time being lazy. I move around a little, 
    usually to go to the bathroom or to get some junk food from the kitchen. I live with my parents and a rather 
    feisty cat who doesn't like when my friends come over. I like playing hockey and lacrosse, but I'm forced to 
    practice piano "because I'm good at it". I code a little, and I'm not the best, but I can get a scratch cat to 
    move 10 steps. But anyways, I think that's enough about me for now, so yeah! See you on the next page!</p>
    
    <h3>Me as a CS Student</h3>
    
    <p>In terms of coding, I have some decent experience. I've been able to code in black format for like 5 years, and learned 
       a little HTML and JavaScript prior to starting this course through both online courses and weekend classes.</p>
